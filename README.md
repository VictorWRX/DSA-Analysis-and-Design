# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was trying to solve for these projects in this course was to implement a data structure that would run efficiently and work well with the data and how it should be used.


# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by figuring out what needed to be in the project. Would the program need insertion, deletion, searching, and resizing of the elements. Understanding data structures makes this process easier to figure out what type of structure should be used.


# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The way I overcame my roadblocks were by using zyBooks to figure out the structure of the data structures and by using previous assignments as guides to figure out what I needed to do.


# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This work has expanded my approach by making sure I understand the complexities and usage of various types of data structures when it comes to implementing code.


# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project in general helped me understand how to code better and maintain code that can be reusable in various situations. For example, I could put in a way to make the project resize depending on how many inputs there are from the file. Learning things like this is very valuable for future use.
